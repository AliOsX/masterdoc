          <h1 id="what-39-s-a-dip">What&rsquo;s a DIP?</h1>

<p>DIPs are accessory boards that give new capabilities to C.H.I.P.  DIPs come in many flavors, like official Next Thing Co. HDMI and VGA DIPs that give C.H.I.P. higher resolution video output to community DIPs that add more USB ports, control motors, or blink LEDs.  C.H.I.P.s (with the proper software) automatically recognize when a DIP is attached and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Here you&rsquo;ll find specs and instructions for the official Next Thing Co. HDMI and VGA DIPs as well as tips and tricks to get you started making your own.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>To properly recognize official NTC DIPs, C.H.I.P.s will need to update the OS.</p>

<h2 id="attaching-dips">Attaching DIPs</h2>

<p><img alt="Attach the DIP" src="images/images/attach.jpg" /></p>

<p>To connect a DIP to C.H.I.P., orient the USB connector opposite the video connector. Align the pins to C.H.I.P.&rsquo;s headers and gently press with even force until the two pieces are joined.</p>

<h2 id="disconnect-the-dip">Disconnect the DIP</h2>

<p>With great care! It&rsquo;s important to pull with an even force to separate the DIP from the CHIP. You do not want bent header pins on your DIP! We&rsquo;ve found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_extractor">IC Extractor</a> is an excellent companion if you want to frequently remove DIPs.</p>

          <h1 id="hdmi-dip">HDMI DIP</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The HDMI DIP allows C.H.I.P. to connect to a monitor or television via an HDMI cable at a maximum resolution of 1920 by 1080 at 30Hz (a.k.a, 1080p). This DIP only provides a video signal over the HDMI cable: there is no audio encoded with it.</p>

<p>The HDMI DIP makes C.H.I.P. even better for traditional uses like presentations, classrooms, and games, and makes amazing things like <a href="http://blog.nextthing.co/this-is-how-we-made-the-75-tall-mega-pocketc-h-i-p/">large-scale installations</a>, magic mirrors, and <a href="http://c-uir.org/mup/">urban projection</a>. </p>

<h2 id="parts-and-pieces">Parts and Pieces</h2>

<h3 id="what-39-s-in-the-bag">What&rsquo;s in the Bag?</h3>

<p>There is one HDMI DIP in the electrostatic bag, packaged with protective foam.&lsquo;HDMI cables and C.H.I.P.s are sold separately <a href="https://getchip.com/pages/store">at getchip.com</a></p>

<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>

<p><img alt="HDMI DIP Callout Graphic" src="images/hdmi_callout.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Power switch: We added this is located on the top edge of the PCB, as it is close to impossible to access it. </li>
<li>Prototyping area - There is &ldquo;Proto board&rdquo; on the PCB itself. This is convenient if you would like to add a small circuit to your DIP, without having to add another board.</li>
<li>U14 partial breakout - This makes it easy to access the GPIO, UART, audio, and ground pins.</li>
<li>Volts - 5V &amp; 3V voltages are available below the NTC proto area. </li>
<li>HDMI connector - A standard HDMI connector is used to send your video to a monitor, and is located at the bottom of the PCB.<br></li>
<li>The Video Processor is the brains of the HDMI DIP. It takes the video from the LCD_Dx pins.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>C.H.I.P. with C.H.I.P. OS 1.1</li>
<li>HDMI display</li>
<li>HDMI cable</li>
</ul>

<p>If you not sure of your OS, <a href="#update_to_debian44">follow this guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-it">Use It</h2>

<p><img alt="Plug it!" src="images/hdmi_plugged_in_half.jpg" /></p>

<p>The HDMI DIP is extremely easy to use. Once you have your C.H.I.P. OS updated, it•s really as simple as attaching the DIP to your C.H.I.P, plugging in an HDMI monitor, and booting up C.H.I.P. But, for posterity•s sake, here•s all the details. </p>

<ul>
<li>Connect DIP to C.H.I.P.</li>
<li>Connect cable to DIP and monitor</li>
<li>Power up C.H.I.P.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once C.H.I.P has power, you&rsquo;ll start seeing output on your monitor. Once C.H.I.P is booted, you may want to change the resolution. You can do this with the control panel found in the Computer Things menu, going to Settings/Display </p>

<p><img alt="display control panel" src="images/settings_select.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the Display control panel, you can select a resolution in the Outputs menu:</p>

<p><img alt="Change Resolutions" src="images/settings_hdmi_resolution.jpg" /></p>

<p>After you select a resolution, you&rsquo;ll need to &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; it:</p>

<p><img alt="apply the new resolution" src="images/settings_apply.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you like using commandline in the terminal, you can change resolutions with <code class="prettyprint">xrandr</code>, such as</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>xrandr -s 1280x720
</code></pre>

<h2 id="know-it">Know it</h2>

<h3 id="supported-resolutions">Supported Resolutions</h3>

<p>We cannot provide an exhaustive list of all resolutions, since this can depend on the attached monitor, but here are some observed resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>1360x768</li>
<li>1920x1080</li>
<li>1680x1050</li>
<li>1280x1024</li>
<li>1280x960</li>
<li>1280x800</li>
<li>1280x720</li>
<li>1024x768</li>
<li>800x600</li>
<li>720x480</li>
<li>640x480</li>
<li>720x400</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-only">Video Only</h3>

<p>HDMI DIP only does video - it does not carry an audio signal. However, the audio connectors on the 3.5mm TRRS jack and header pins still output stereo audio normally.</p>

<p>VGA DIP is open source. Design files are in our <a href="https://github.com/NextThingCo/DIP-HDMI-PCB">github repo.</a></p>

          <h1 id="vga-dip">VGA DIP</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The VGA DIP allows C.H.I.P. to connect to a monitor via a standard 9-pin VGA cable at a maximum output resolution of 1600 by 900 at 60 Hz. Unlike the 16:9 ratio of HDMI, the VGA DIP outputs in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p>

<h2 id="parts-and-pieces">Parts and Pieces</h2>

<h3 id="what-39-s-in-the-bag">What&rsquo;s in the Bag</h3>

<p>There is one VGA DIP in the electrostatic bag, packaged with protective foam. VGA cables and C.H.I.P.s are sold separately <a href="https://getchip.com/pages/store">at getchip.com</a></p>

<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>

<p><img alt="VGA DIP Callout Graphic" src="images/vga_callout.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
<li>RGB breakouts - RGB breakouts can be found at the edge of the VGA connector on the left side. These are available if you ever want to add cool effects, or to &ldquo;bend&rdquo; your VGA DIP</li>
<li>Trim-pot breakouts (RGB) - There are three footprints for1 0K trimpots. These can be installed with only a few solder joints, and can create a really awesome visual effects like saturating colors.</li>
<li>U14 breakouts - The U14 header breakout is directly to the left of U14. This is important if you would like to access FEL, UART, XIO, CSID, audio, etc. The name of each pin is labeled above the corresponding pad.</li>
<li>JST connector breakout - A JST connector footprint  is available to be populated on VGA DIP. Because the VGA connector is really close to the existing JST battery connector, it makes it difficult to plug/unplug with the VGA DIP installed. Note: DO NOT INSTALL TWO BATTERIES INTO C.H.I.P. THIS WILL DAMAGE YOUR C.H.I.P. </li>
<li>Prototyping area - There is &ldquo;Proto board&rdquo; on the PCB itself. This is convenient if you would like to add a small circuit to your VGA DIP, without having to add another board.</li>
<li>VGA connector - This is a standard female DB-15 VGA connector to carry the video signal to a VGA monitor. </li>
<li>Power switch - A Power switch has been added to the VGA DIP. It is close to impossible to access the Power On Switch on C.H.I.P with the VGA DIP installed, so we added a second Power On Switch. This is located on the right side of the PCB, and is accompanied by a &ldquo;Power On&rdquo; symbol. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>C.H.I.P. with C.H.I.P. OS 1.1</li>
<li>VGA display</li>
<li>VGA cable (we recommend a cable with Ferrite beads)
If youneed to update your OS, <a href="getchip.com/update">follow this guide</a></li>

<h2 id="hack-it">Hack It</h2>

<p>Heat up your soldering iron, the VGA DIP is hackable. You may have noticed the pads suitably spaced for 10K trim pots, and the RGB breakouts. Here&rsquo;s a photo guide to soldering up some trim pots so you can manually adjust the individual red, green, and blue levels in the image. You can find <a href="http://www.bourns.com/docs/Product-Datasheets/3386.pdf">these pots</a> at vendors such as <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/bourns-inc/3386P-1-103TLF/3386P-103TLF-ND/1232547">digikey</a> and <a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Bourns/3386P-1-103TLF/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvygUB3GLcD7rufck0TIBKysL9OZJpl%2f%2fo%3d">mouser</a></p>

<p>Trim pots are able to go in one way on TOP of the PCB for accessibility.</p>

<p><img alt="able to go in one way" src="images/vgapot_01place.jpg" /></p>

<p>Trim pots are sized and spaced for a precise alignment.</p>

<p><img alt="sized and spaced for a precise alignment" src="images/vgapot_02allpots.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here we see that there is only one way for the pots to go on the TOP side.</p>

<p><img alt="only one way for the pots to go" src="images/vgapot_03thruhole.jpg" /></p>

<p>Solder the leads and trim them like so.</p>
